        <h2 class="sectionHeader">Soccer</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            I first started playing soccer when I was 4 years old. According to my parents, I used to hate it, and ran over to them crying during every
            practice because I didn't want to play anymore. Luckily for me, my attitude towards soccer improved pretty quickly. I continued playing soccer competively
            year round until I graduated high school.
            <br>
            Outside of playing soccer, I also love watching professional soccer in my free time. I have been a fan of Liverpool FC since I first started paying
            attention to pro soccer. I have been lucky enough to attend two Liverpool matches over the past few years. I got to watch Liverpool play Manchester United
            in the Big House in 2018 and them play Dortmund in 2019 in Notre Dame Stadium. Besides Liverpool games, I was also able to attend all 4 matches in 
            Chicago during the 2016 Copa America. In these matches, I saw Messi score a 30 minute hat trick against Panama, team USA defeat Costa Rica 4-0, and an
            intense match between Chile and Colombia in the semi-finals.
            <br>
            Though I didn't get to see a game there, I got to see the Camp Nou when I was in Barcelona. Which has been one the best things I've seen while
            traveling.

        <h2 class="sectionHeader">Kayaking</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Since I was in middle school, I have loved kayaking for fun. My parents got me a kayak for getting good grades one year, and
            I used it on the lake/river from then until the end of college.<br>
            I have been kayaking a few times in the city since coming to Seattle, and I am looking to finding new places outside the
            city to kayak this year. Ideally I'd like to find beautiful places to kayak across the Pacific Northwest.
