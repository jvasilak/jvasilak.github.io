        <div class="paragraph">
            I started playing soccer when I was 4 years old. According to my parents, I used to hate it, and I ran over to them crying during every
            practice because I didn't want to play. Luckily, my attitude improved very quickly and I decided to keep playing. I continued playing recreationally until
            high school and played for my high school and a club team while I was in high school. Since graduating high school I kept playing casually and have no plans of stopping
            anytime soon.

            Outside of playing, I also love following professional soccer in my free time. I am a Liverpool fan, and have been lucky enough to attend two Liverpool friendly matches. I was also able to attend all 4 matches in 
            Chicago during the 2016 Copa America, where I saw Messi score a 30 minute hat trick against Panama, team USA defeat Costa Rica 4-0, and an
            intense match between Chile and Colombia in the semi-finals.

            Though I didn't get to see a game there, I also got to see the Camp Nou while I was in Barcelona. The stadium and museum in the stadium were one of the coolest
            things I have seen while traveling and I strongly recommend seeing it if you have the chance.

            I have been enjoyed kayaking since middle school, when my parents bought me my own kayak which I used through the end of college. Since moving to Seattle I have also been kayaking a few times and want to 
            try kayaking outside of the city as well. Last year, I also bought an inflatable rowboat I have been taking out and fishing on.
