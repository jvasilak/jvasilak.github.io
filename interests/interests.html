            I have been playing soccer since I was 4 years old. For the next 14 years, I played organized soccer year round, only stopping,
            after graduation. During high school I played for my high school team in the summer and fall and 
            with my club team in the winter and spring. I have always enjoyed playing defense, especially center back, as that is where I 
            am most comfortable on the field. Now I still enjoy playing pickup games with my friends or playing intramurally. My first job was 
            as an indoor soccer referee, and I have since reffed on campus at Notre Dame as well to make some extra money. In addition to playing soccer 
            I love to watch professional soccer as well. My favorite club is the English club Liverpool FC. I have been lucky enough to see Liverpool play
            two matches in person, one at Notre Dame. I also love playing the latest iteration of the FIFA video game series as well, although I 
            do not play as much since starting college because I have less time.

            Growing up, playing video games, especially with my friends, was one of my favorite things to do. My favorite video game growing up 
            was <i>Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (2005)</i>. I still play it very sometimes but not regularly. I also had a Nintendo Wii growing up,
            and would always play with my best friends. Since starting college, I have less time for gaming. Despite this I still try to play whenever I get 
            the time to. The main games I play currently are story games, shooters, <i>FIFA</i>, and the most recent <i>F1</i> game.
