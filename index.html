            Hi! I'm Jonathon Vasilak. I currently live and work in Seattle, WA. I go by both Jonathon or Jon. 
            I work as a software engineer for Amazon Enterprise Engineering. Prior to working for Amazon, I attended the University of Notre
            Dame, where I graduated with a degree in Computer Science. Even before that, I grew up in Griffith, Indiana where I graduated 
            from Griffith High School.
