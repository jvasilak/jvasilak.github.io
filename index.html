            Welcome to my website! I am Jonathon Vasilak and this is my personal website. I currently live in Seattle and work 
            as a software engineer for AWS. Prior to working for Amazon, I attended the University of Notre
            Dame, where I graduated with a degree in Computer Science. Even before that, I grew up in Griffith, Indiana where I graduated 
            from Griffith High School.
             
            Below you can find links to some of my social media accounts.

            Thanks for visiting!

            This website is an ongoing personal project of mine. 
            I intend to add a few future programming projects in the near future as well as continuously improve the source code as I find
            the time.
