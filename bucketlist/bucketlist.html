        <div class="pageTitle">My Bucket List</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            3 years ago I decided to create my first bucket list while I was bored in an airport. Since then I have added a lot more to
            my bucket list and have made some progress checking off some of the items on the list. There is a large section of my bucket list dedicated
            to the places I wish to travel to, which are included on the <a href="../travels/travels.html">travels</a> page of my website.
        </div>
        <h2 class="sectionHeader">Items I Have Checked Off</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Here is a list of all of the items on my bucket list that I have completed so far.

                <div class="sublist">I checked this one off when I saw Leon Bridges in May 2025. I've been to several other concerts since then, including: Tate McRae, Big Sean, and Bad Suns.</div>

                    It took me 2 years to fully complete, but I have a living dex of all Pokemon released through generation 8 in Pokemon Home, 
                    which was the most recent generation out when I added this to my list.
                </div>
                <div class="sublist">
                    I also have all but 4 of the generation 9 Pokemon and plan to add them to my living dex as soon as I can.
