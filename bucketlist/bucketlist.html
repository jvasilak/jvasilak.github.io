            3 years ago I decided to create my first bucket list while I was bored in an airport. Since then I have added a lot more to
            my bucket list and have also managed to complete a few items on the list. There is a large section of my bucket list dedicated
            to the places I wish to travel to, which are included on the <a href="../travels/travels.html">travels</a> page of my website.
