            I attended high school at Griffith High School in Griffith, Indiana. I graduated high schoool in 2019.
            Between 2019 and 2023 I attended the University of Notre Dame, where I studied Computer Science. Listed below are all of the
            classes I have taken during my time at Notre Dame. I plan to add some of the work I completed during my time as a student as part
            of future work on my website.
