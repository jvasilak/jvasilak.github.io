            <p>
                I currently work as a software developer in AWS IoT. My team owns several backend services. external API's, technical writing, internal tools, infrastructure management, security, compliance. 
                I also work with many other AWS services on a daily basis as they are dependencies of our software. These included but are not limited to: EC2, AWS OpenSearch, DDB, S3, and SWF.
                I am also responsible for overseeing the operational health of our services while I am on call.

            <p class="jobTime"><i>May 2022 - August 2022</i></p>
            <p>
                Using React and TypeScript, I developed front end components AWS IoT customers could use to interact with some new features
                being released. My internship required me to develop a design plan, write code based on the design, and implement tests
                to ensure the code I wrote behaved as expected. Part of the work I completed has been implemented and
                productionized since completing my internship.

            <p class="projectDate"><i>(Spring 2022)</i></p>
            <p>
                Built and programmed a droid for the duration of a semester. Droid consisted of motors, sensors, sound, 
                display, and a servo. Designed parts using CAD software and 3D printed the designs. Programming was done using Arduino's IDE. 
                The droid was programmed to complete preprogrammed tasks at the push of a button. It could also be controlled directly by the user.

            <p>
                Built a webapp using React.js. Project consisted front end and back end development. Worked in an Agile manner by completing new features every two weeks.
                Features added to the webapp included login/authentication components, data entry, and protected admin components. 
                Webapp includes some CSS code for styling. Unit testing was also done to validate components work as expected.

            <p>
                Wrote python scripts to handle real IndyCar timing data. Script simulates a race running, all timing events are handled in order they would occur in a real race.
                Code analyzes transponder data and records overtakes. Script also determines whether Push to Pass (P2P) aided the overtake. Statistics on overtake and use of P2P were
                recorded and outputted in JSON. Project was completed in a group setting with other students and an industry mentor.

                Reverse engineered an old Windows executable file for Solitaire. From reading memory values in the running program, determined the location
                of all cards and generated an algorithm to guide a player to victory. Algorithm would try all possible moves 6 moves at a time, then determined
                best set of 6 moves based on how close it got the user to winning the game.
